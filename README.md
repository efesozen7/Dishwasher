<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a project I have built in the 1st quarter of the 1st year of my Bachelor Degree. Essentially, this project is about a non-existant appliance company called "CoolRed", displaying their catalogue of items on the command line. Some of the features I have implemented is sorting and retrieving catalogues of items from certain data structures, reading data from text files and creating catalogues, writing to files, and multi-threading while sorting.
